# Cool fact

I managed to get my dependencies while on the airplane by using

```example
flutter pub get --offline
```

 When "flutter pub get" is run by the create command,
                             this indicates whether to run it in offline mode or
                             not. In offline mode, it will need to have all
                             dependencies already available in the pub cache to
                             succeed.
